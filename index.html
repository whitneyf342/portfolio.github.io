            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Whitney Fields I am a college student studying philosophy at the University Of Oregon
            the idea is to apply critical thinking skills learned from my philosophy
            degree in a law setting, whether it be starting my own practice, working with my
            dad at his practice, or working as an attorney for the Fed. "On the side" I make content for platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok. I've been uploading videos on YouTube for nearly 3 years,
            sporadically, there hasn't been much consisten uploading. However, as I move forwards into 2025 with new dreams and aspirations,
            I expect to be more harsh on myself when it comes to upload consistency and accountability. "One must consider the time he's been
            alloted and what he does with said time" something I've thought a lot about recently, something I aim to implement into my personal
            life to test my meddle and mental fortitude. </p>
